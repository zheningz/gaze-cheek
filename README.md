# Gaze + Cheek: Hands-free System Control in VR

## Overview
This project introduces a hands-free system control technique for seamlessly controlling numerical parameters. 
By leveraging innovative interaction techniques, this system enhances accessibility, multitasking capabilities, and user experience in performance settings.

## Design
The Gaze + Cheek combines gaze tracking with cheek movement. 
- Gaze: a selection method through hovering an item.
- Cheek puffs and sucks: a dynamic input to manipulate values through the metaphor of inflating and deflating a parameter.

## Use Case
Imagine a musician needing to adjust track levels while performing. 
This system enables hands-free multitrack volume control, ensuring the focus remains on the performance. Whether in a VR environment or a live setting, this project aims to improve multitasking and accessibility for artists and performers.

## Hardware Requirements
Quest Pro
